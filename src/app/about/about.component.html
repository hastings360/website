				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am passionate about web development and learning more each day by
					creating new and inventive online tools.</p>
				<p>Taking photos is one of my hobbies, and being able to choose from my own stock images plays an important part
					in my applcation development.</p>
				<p>I have worked in tech for a long time and have both masters' and bachelors' degrees
					focusing on computer networking, infrastructure, and web deployment.  MEAN.JS is my choice stack to develop in, 
					but I also have some experience with PHP, C# and .NET.  Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me about anything.</p>
